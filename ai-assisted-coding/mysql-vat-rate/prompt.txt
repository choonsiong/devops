MySQL: I have a table to store VAT rates for different countries. This is the table definition:

CREATE TABLE vat (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    country CHAR(2) NOT NULL,
    rate DOUBLE NOT NULL,
    validFrom DATE NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

I want to get the VAT rate for a country (i.e., 'de') at a given time ('2024-04-15'). What should the query look like?



Would this also work with Microsoft SQL server?
